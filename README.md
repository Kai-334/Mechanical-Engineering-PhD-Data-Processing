# Mechanical Engineering PhD Data Processing

This repository contains MATLAB scripts for processing and analyzing wave propagation data as part of my mechanical engineering PhD research.

## Project Overview

The scripts perform the following tasks:

- Importing data from simulation or experimental results.
- Visualizing raw and filtered wave data.
- Applying digital filters and time-gating.
- Performing 2D Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis.
- Overlaying theoretical dispersion curves.
- Calculating participating factors for different modes.

## File Structure

- `src/`: Contains all MATLAB scripts.
- `data/`: Contains input data files required for the analysis.
- `figures/`: (Optional) Stores generated figures.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure that MATLAB is installed on your system.
3. Place your data files in the `data/` directory.
4. Run `main_script.m` from the `src/` directory.

## Dependencies

- MATLAB R2020a or later.
- Signal Processing Toolbox.

## Usage

Modify the parameters in `main_script.m` as needed, such as file paths and analysis settings.
